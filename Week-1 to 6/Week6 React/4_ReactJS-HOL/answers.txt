Q1. Explain the need and Benefits of component life cycle.
Ans1. The component lifecycle provides specific points in a component's existence to run code, from its creation to its destruction. This allows developers to control a component's behavior, like fetching data when it appears or cleaning up before it disappears.

Q2. Identify various life cycle hook methods.
Ans2. For class components, key methods are componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount. For functional components, the useEffect hook handles all these lifecycle events for setup, updates, and cleanup.

Q3. List the sequence of steps in rendering a component.
Ans3. First, React runs the render method to create a virtual representation of the UI. Then, it updates the actual browser DOM to match and finally calls componentDidMount (or the useEffect hook) after the component is on the screen.
