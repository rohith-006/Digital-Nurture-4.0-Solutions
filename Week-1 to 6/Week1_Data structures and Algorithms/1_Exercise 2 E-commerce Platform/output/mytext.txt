Understand Asymptotic Notation:
1.Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.

Big O tells us how fast or slow an algorithm grows with input size. It helps us understand performance of our Algorithm

2.Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.

Best Case: The item is found at the beginning

Average Case: The item is found in the middle

Worst Case: The item is at the end or not present at all


ANALYSIS:
1.Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.

Linear Search : O(n)
Binary Search : O(log n)

2.Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.

Both has their use cases based on the input and other constraints like
Linear Search is used when data is unsorted and small.
Binary Search is used when data is sorted and large.
