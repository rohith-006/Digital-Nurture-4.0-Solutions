Q)Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.

Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve smaller parts of a problem like Caculating a factorial of number, fiibonacci numbers etc.

Analysis:
--------

1.Discuss the time complexity of your recursive algorithm.

Depends on how many times the function calls itself and what each call does.
Eg: for fibanocci O(2^n)


2.Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation.

Use Memoization/dp
Store results of already calculated subproblems in an array or map so you don't redo the same work
