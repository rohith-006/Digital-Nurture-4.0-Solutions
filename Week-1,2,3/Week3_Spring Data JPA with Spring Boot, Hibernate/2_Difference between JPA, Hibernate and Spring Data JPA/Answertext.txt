1. JPA (Java Persistence API)
JPA is a Java EE specification for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).

It defines how Java objects map to database tables using annotations and interfaces.

JPA is only an interface â€” it needs an implementation like Hibernate or EclipseLink.



2. Hibernate
Hibernate is the most popular JPA provider.

Can be used:

As a JPA implementation (standard way).

With its own native APIs for more flexibility.

Offers advanced features like custom joins, caching, lazy loading, and native SQL support.



3. Spring Data JPA
A Spring abstraction built on top of JPA.

Simplifies data access by providing prebuilt repository interfaces (like JpaRepository).

Handles CRUD operations, pagination, and queries with almost zero boilerplate code.

Internally still uses a JPA provider like Hibernate.
