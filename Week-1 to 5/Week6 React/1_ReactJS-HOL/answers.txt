Q1. Define SPA and its benefits.
Ans1. A Single-Page Application (SPA) is a website that loads one HTML page and updates content dynamically. Its main benefit is providing a faster, smoother user experience without page reloads.

Q2. Define React and identify its working.
Ans2. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces using reusable pieces called components. It works by using a virtual DOM to efficiently update only the necessary parts of a page.

Q3. Identify the differences between SPA and MPA.
Ans3. SPAs load a single page and update content dynamically, feeling fast and fluid. MPAs are traditional websites that reload a full new page from a server for every click.

Q4. Explain Pros & Cons of Single-Page Application.
Ans4. Pros of SPAs are speed and a rich user experience. Cons include a potentially slow initial load and challenges with search engine optimization (SEO).

Q5. Explain about React.
Ans5. React is a popular JavaScript library for creating interactive user interfaces in a declarative way. It uses a component-based structure to build complex applications from small, isolated pieces of code.

Q6. Define virtual DOM.
Ans6. The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual browser DOM kept in memory. React uses it to figure out the minimal changes needed, which makes updates very fast.

Q7. Explain Features of React.
Ans7. React's main features are its component-based architecture for reusable UI and JSX syntax for writing HTML in JavaScript. It also uses a virtual DOM for high performance and has one-way data flow for predictable code.
