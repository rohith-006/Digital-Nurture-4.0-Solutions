Q1. Explain React components.
Ans1. React components are reusable, independent blocks of code that describe a piece of the user interface. You combine these small pieces, like a button or a form, to build your entire web page.

Q2. Identify the differences between components and JavaScript functions.
Ans2. A regular JavaScript function can return any data, but a React component must return UI elements (JSX). Components also start with a capital letter and receive "props" as their one argument.

Q3. Identify the types of components.
Ans3. The two main types are functional components and class components. Functional components are modern JavaScript functions, while class components are older and use ES6 classes.

Q4. Explain class component.
Ans4. A class component is an ES6 class that extends React.Component and contains a render() method to return UI. It manages its own data using this.state and has access to special lifecycle methods.

Q5. Explain function component.
Ans5. A function component is a simple JavaScript function that accepts "props" and returns UI elements. They use React Hooks to manage state, and are the modern, standard way to write components.

Q6. Define component constructor.
Ans6. The constructor is a special method in a class component that runs when the component is created. It is primarily used to initialize the component's state and to bind event handlers.

Q7. Define render() function.
Ans7. The render() function is a required method inside a class component that returns the UI (as JSX). React calls this function to display the component and update it when its data changes.
